## 🚀 Running Redis

You need Redis running locally for Celery to work.

* **On Linux / Mac (with Homebrew or apt):**

```bash
redis-server
```

* **On Windows:**
  Download Redis from [Memurai (Redis for Windows)](https://www.memurai.com/) or use **Docker**:

```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

---

## ⚡ Celery Setup

### Start Celery Worker

```bash
celery -A crm worker -l info
```

### Start Celery Beat (Scheduler)

```bash
celery -A crm beat -l info
```

---

## 📝 Logs

Generated reports and scheduled tasks are logged to:

```
/tmp/crm_report_log.txt
```

You can tail the logs with:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/crm_report_log.txt
```

---

## ✅ Verify

1. Start Redis.
2. Run `celery -A crm worker -l info`.
3. Run `celery -A crm beat -l info`.
4. Check `/tmp/crm_report_log.txt` for new log entries.

```

Do you want me to also **add this README.md file directly under `crm/` with git commands** (`git add crm/README.md && git commit -m "Add setup README" && git push`), or you just want the file contents for now?
